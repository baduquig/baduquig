# Gabe Baduqui
<br> 
Hello Github community. I am an early career Software Systems Engineer and am interested in data analysis and database management. I have a lot of professional experience with on-premisis and cloud-based human capital management systems as well as relational database development. In my spare time, I am working on improving my data analysis skills in python.
<br><br>
I am looking for a community with similar interests! Feel free to reach out and connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-baduqui/).
